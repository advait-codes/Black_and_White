## Hi there 👋
  This is my first scratch game I made solo. I am currently in my high school (class 9) so it can be unpolished for some people.
  
<!- This is my projet but decideed to upload it on itch.io instead of scratch because i wanted to increase the size of the satage to 1920x10280

- 🔭 I’m currently studying in school and some free courses from harvard and etc realted to basic coding
- 🌱 I want to become a great engeenier so i thought this might be a starting step
- Here is lnk of my project https://advait121a.itch.io/white-and-balck
- And this is my dashboard https://advait121a.itch.io/
- Just try and comment this is what I want.

- Thanks 🎁
